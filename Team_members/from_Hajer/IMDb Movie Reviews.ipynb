    "\n",
    "## **1. Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1. Use the IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1.2. Dataset contains 50,000 labeled movie reviews (positive/negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.3. Focus on the review text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Cleaning Steps**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "2.6. Perform lemmatization (reduce words to their base form).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.7. Keep only meaningful tokens (length > 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Deliverables**\n",
    "\n",
    "3.1. A cleaned dataset with original review and cleaned review text.\n",
